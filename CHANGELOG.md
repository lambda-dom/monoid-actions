# Changelog.

## One is Glad to be of Service: v0.1.1

* Minor changes to the cabal file.
* Bungled monoid identities in Summation and Multiplication.
* Missing monoid action.

note(s):
* strictly speaking, by [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/) the major version should be bumped, but since v0.1 is the initial release unreleased, this is not a problem.

## Version 0.1

* Initial release unreleased.
